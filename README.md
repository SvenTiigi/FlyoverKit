`FlyoverKit` enables you to present stunning 360¬∞ flyover views on an `MKMapView` with zero effort while maintaining full configuration possibilities. `FlyoverKit` builds the core of [STLocationRequest](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/STLocationRequest) which enables you a way to request the user location services via a 3D 360¬∞ flyover MapView.

## Example

<img style="float: right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTiigi/FlyoverKit/gh-pages/readMeAssets/FlyoverKitExampleApplication.gif" alt="Example Application Screenshot" align="right" width="307">

The example Application is an excellent way to see `FlyoverKit` in action. You get a brief look of the available configuration options and how they affect the flyover behaviour. Simply open the `FlyoverKit.xcodeproj` and run the `FlyoverKit-Example` scheme. Please keep in mind that the `SatelliteFlyover` and `HybridFlyover` will only work on a real iOS device.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

FlyoverKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'FlyoverKit'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate FlyoverKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "SvenTiigi/FlyoverKit"
```

Run `carthage update --platform iOS` to build the framework and drag the built `FlyoverKit.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SvenTiigi/FlyoverKit.git", from: "1.3.1")
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate FlyoverKit into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage
`FlyoverKit` can be implemented in three different ways. Simply choose the most suitable type for your implementation. Please see the [Advanced](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/FlyoverKit#advanced) section in order to configure the `FlyoverKit` to your needs.

### FlyoverCamera
If you already have a `MKMapView` in your `Controller` and you want to add a flyover to this MapView, simply use the `FlyoverCamera`.

```swift
import FlyoverKit

// Initialize the FlyoverCamera with an already existing MKMapView
let flyoverCamera = FlyoverCamera(mapView: self.mapView)

// Initialize a location via CLLocationCoordinate2D
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 48.858370, longitude: 2.294481)

// Start flyover
flyoverCamera.start(flyover: eiffelTower)
```

### FlyoverMapView
If you wish to show a MapView which is already preconfigured to perform a flyover on a given location, you should use the `FlyoverMapView`.

```swift
import FlyoverKit

// Initialize the FlyoverMapView
let flyoverMapView = FlyoverMapView()

// Initialize a location via CLLocation
let eiffelTower = CLLocation(latitude: 48.858370, longitude: 2.294481)

// Start flyover
flyoverMapView.start(flyover: eiffelTower)
```

### FlyoverMapViewController
If you wish to present a `UIViewController` with an embedded `FlyoverMapView` to perform a flyover on a given location, `FlyoverMapViewController` is at your service.

```swift
import FlyoverKit

// Initialize a location via FlyoverAwesomePlace
let eiffelTower = FlyoverAwesomePlace.parisEiffelTower

// Initialize the FlyoverMapViewController with a Flyover object
let controller = FlyoverMapViewController(flyover: eiffelTower)

// Present controller
self.present(controller, animated: true)
```

## Advanced
The `FlyoverKit` consists of three main components. The `Flyover` protocol, `FlyoverCamera` and `FlyoverMapView`.¬†

   <br/>
</p>

## Flyover Protocol
The `flyover` protocol specifies a type with a `CLLocationCoordinat2D` property. It is used to perform a flyover on the given coordinate.

```swift
public protocol Flyover {
    var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D { get }
}
```
The `FlyoverKit` already implemented this protocol to various MapKit and CoreLocation types like `CLLocationCoordinate2D`, `CLLocation`, `MKMapPoint`, `MKMapItem`, `MKCoordinateRegion` and many [more](https://sventiigi.github.io/FlyoverKit/Extensions.html).

You can apply the `Flyover` protocol to your own models to use them for a flyover.

```swift
struct Address {
    var name: String
    var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D
}
extension Address: Flyover {}
```

### Operators
In order to compare two `Flyover` types you can use the following two operators.

#### Equatable operator (==)

```swift
self.flyover1 == self.flyover2
```
> Checks if the two given Flyover types are exactly the same via comparison of latitude and longitude.

#### Rounded Equatable operator (~~)

```swift
self.flyover1 ~~ self.flyover2
```
> Checks if the two given Flyover types are nearly the same via comparison of rounded latitude and longitude.

### FlyoverAwesomePlace
The `FlyoverAwesomePlace` is a `Flyover` protocol compliant Enumeration with awesome locations and landmarks like `NewYorkStatueOfLiberty`, `GooglePlex`, `SydneyOperaHouse` and many [more](https://sventiigi.github.io/FlyoverKit/Enums/FlyoverAwesomePlace.html). You can use them in your own implementation or to explore different locations in the `FlyoverKitExample` Application.

## FlyoverCamera
The `FlyoverCamera` is responsible for manipulating the `MKMapView` camera and performs a 360¬∞ flyover animation via [UIViewPropertyAnimator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewpropertyanimator). 

In order to initialize a `FlyoverCamera` object you need to pass a `MKMapView` (which reference will be weakly stored) and a `FlyoverCamera.Configuration` object.

```swift
// Initialize FlyoverCamera configuration
let configuration = FlyoverCamera.Configuration(
    duration: 4.0,
    altitude: 600.0,
    pitch: 45.0,
    headingStep: 20.0
)

// Initialize FlyoverCamera
let camera = FlyoverCamera(
    mapView: mapView,
    configuration: configuration
)

// Start Flyover
camera.start(flyover: location)
```

### Configuration
The `FlyoverCamera.Configuration` struct holds all specific flyover configuration values. Set the properties to get the right look and feel of the flyover as you need it to be.

| Configuration      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| duration      | The flyover animation duration |
| altitude      | The altitude above the ground, measured in meters      |
| pitch | The viewing angle of the camera, measured in degrees      |
| headingStep | The direction step in degrees that is added to the MapViewCamera heading in each flyover iteration |
| regionChangeAnimation | The region change animation that should be applied if a flyover has been started and the MapCamera has to change the region. Default is always `.none` which immediately present the place. If you wish that the region change should be performed via an animation you can set `.animated(duration: 1.5, curve: .easeIn)`      |

    </a>
</p>

### Configuration Theme
If you don't want to set the properties yourself you can use a preconfigured configuration theme. Currently there are four themes available 

| Theme      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| default | Default flyover configuration with configuration for a default flyover usage |
| lowFlying | Flyover configuration with a low altitude and a high pitch. Simulates a low flying helicopter viewing angle |
| farAway | Configuration with a high altitude and a normal pitch which results in a far away viewing angle |
| giddy | A giddy configuration ü§¢ which you shouldn't use in production. But it's fun ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§ô|
| astronautView | The view of an astronaut üåé |

Furthermore, you can initialize a `FlyoverCamera` with a given `Theme`.

```swift
// Initialize FlyoverCamera
let camera = FlyoverCamera(
    mapView: mapView,
    configuration: .default
)
```

More themes coming soon... üë®‚Äçüíª

## FlyoverMapView
The `FlyoverMapView` is a preconfigured `MKMapView` with an embedded `FlyoverCamera`. The `FlyoverMapView` offers various convenience functions for example starting a flyover with a `MKAnnotation` object or setting a supported flyover `MapType`.

```swift
// Initialize with default configuration theme and standard MapType
let flyoverMapView = FlyoverMapView()

// Or initialize by setting a different theme and the satelliteFlyover MapType
let flyoverMapView = FlyoverMapView(configuration: .farAway, mapType: .satelliteFlyover)
```

### MapType
The `FlyoverMapView.MapType` specifies the three supported `MKMapType`'s.

| MapType      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| standard      | A street map that shows the position of all roads and shows 3D buildings |
| satelliteFlyover      | A satellite image of the area with road and road name information layered on top |
| hybridFlyover      | A hybrid satellite image with flyover data where available |

### FlyoverMapViewController
The `FlyoverMapViewController` is an easy and simple way to present a `UIViewController` with an embedded `FlyoverMapView`. You can use it if you just want to present a 360¬∞ flyover on a given `Flyover` type.

```swift
// Initialize a location
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(48.858370, 2.294481)

// Initialize the FlyoverMapViewController with a Flyover object
let controller = FlyoverMapViewController(flyover: eiffelTower)

// Present controller
self.present(controller, animated: true)
```

Additionally you can initialize the `FlyoverMapViewController` with your own `Configuration` or `Configuration.Theme` and a `MapType`

```swift
// Initialize a location
let eiffelTower = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(48.858370, 2.294481)

// Initialize a Configuration
let configuration = FlyoverCamera.Configuration(
    duration: 4.0,
    altitude: 600.0,
    pitch: 45.0,
    headingStep: 20.0
)

// Initialize the FlyoverMapViewController
let controller = FlyoverMapViewController(
    flyover: eiffelTower, 
    configuration: configuration, 
    mapType: .satelliteFlyover
)

// Present controller
self.present(controller, animated: true)
```
